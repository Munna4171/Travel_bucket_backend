    // 1. Get username, email, and password from req.body
    // 2. Hash the password

    // 4. Save the user to the database (e.g., MongoDB)
    // 5. Generate a JWT token and set it in a cookie

        // --- MOCK SUCCESS RESPONSE ---
        // We simulate a successful database save and respond with JSON.
        // This resolves the "Not Found" error and satisfies the frontend's fetch call.

            success: true,

// Simple utility for centralized error handling
// Note: You should ensure you have a file at server/utils/error.js for production.
// For now, we rely on Express's default error handling if you don't have it.
